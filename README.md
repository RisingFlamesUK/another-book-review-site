# üìö Bookwork Reviews

Bookwork Reviews is a personal capstone project built to practice and showcase full-stack web development skills. It goes beyond the scope of the original course requirement and is designed to serve as a professional portfolio piece. The project simulates a multi-user book collection and review platform using real-world APIs and a relational database backend.

This was created as Capstone 5 for: **"The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp"** by Dr. Angela Yu (Udemy)

## üéì Project Highlights

- Multi-user access with full authentication
- Persistent user book collections with status tracking
- Rating and review system for book editions
- Fully integrated with the Open Library API
- Book data caching with automatic fallback for missing info
- Custom search results pagination and dynamic cover loading

**Technologies used:**

- `Node.js` (v24.1.0)
- `Express.js`
- `PostgreSQL` (v17)
- `EJS` templating
- `Axios` for HTTP
- `bcrypt` for password security

## ‚öñÔ∏è Capstone Scope vs. Original Requirements

The course required creating a basic book note-taking app. This project expands it to:

- Full authentication system
- Book reviews and star ratings
- Real-time data from Open Library
- Multi-page experience with search, edition browsing, and collection management

Total development time: \~6 weeks (active development)

Passwords are encrypted in the database. If deployed online, you should configure the project to use HTTPS.

## üîó Dependencies: Open Library API

This project uses data from the Open Library: [https://openlibrary.org/developers/api](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)

## ‚åõ TODO / Potential Extensions

I have finished working on this capstone for now as it exceeds the original scope and I need to continue with my course. Here are areas where I think it could do with improvement in case you are looking to build on it.\
Some of this is feedback from user testing:

- **user feedback stretch goal:** update search results page with additional search bar that populates with search last typed (easier to correct typo ‚Äî currently you need to click back or navigate back to browse books and type it all again)
- **user feedback stretch goal:** auto-redirect to the edition page after adding to collection to allow immediate review or status change
- **stretch goal:** create a site navigation bar and move search to it (instead of first goal). Should also have My Books and Browse Books page links (replacing "Find More Books" button)
- **stretch goal:** create cron job to refresh cache with latest data, download trending data and subjects on a schedule
- **user feedback stretch goal:** preserve user's last 5 searches and allow user to return to them
- **stretch goal:** clean up and refactor code with improved comments
- **stretch goal:** add user profile management (including picture upload & default language setting)
- **stretch goal:** update the edition page to allow user notes to be added
- **stretch goal:** add subjects page linked from the browse
- **stretch goal:** implement multi-language support

## üöÄ Getting Started

You need:

- Node.js v24.1.0
- PostgreSQL v17

### 1. Setup `.env`

```bash
touch .env
```

Then edit `.env` with the following:

```env
# BCrypt Gen
SALT_ROUNDS=15

# Postgres
PG_USER=[postgres username]
PG_PASS=[postgres password]
PG_DB=[postgres database name]
PG_PORT=[postgres port]
PG_HOST=[postgres hostname]

# Cache durations
WORK_OLID='7 days'
EDITION_OLID='14 days'
DB_TRENDING_REEL='Daily'
DB_SUBJECT_REEL='Hourly'
```

### 2. Set up the database

Run the queries in `queries.sql` to create required tables.

### 3. Install dependencies and run server

```bash
npm i
npm audit fix   # optional
node app.js     # or use nodemon app.js
```

## üî¢ Original Capstone Requirements

### Goals from the course

- Integrate a public API
- Use CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database
- Build a structured and maintainable Express app
- Render data with EJS templates and client-side JavaScript
- Create a usable and styled frontend
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use GitHub for collaboration and sharing

### Required features

1. **Database Persistence**\
   Use PostgreSQL with proper schema and relational data

2. **Planning**\
   Research APIs, draw ERDs, and plan features before building

3. **Setup**\
   Use Express + EJS + PostgreSQL + pg

4. **API Integration**\
   Use at least one GET request to pull real data

5. **Data Display**\
   Render book cover and metadata from API + DB

6. **Error Handling**\
   Provide user feedback or logs on error cases

7. **Documentation**\
   Well-commented code and clear instructions

8. **Sharing**\
   Push to GitHub with README and instructions
