*Bookwork Reviews*
*----------------*

This site was created in order to practice and showcase my skills and was a capstone project within a udemy course:
"The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp" - Dr Angela Yu

This is Capstone 5, which requires the creation of a Book Notes site. I have gone a few steps further and included multi-user access, user authentication, book reviews and scoring.
All password data is encrypted by the database. I recommend altering the code to use HTTPS to ensure all client server communication is encrypted if you are going to use this on the web.

I use a combination of APIs provided by Open Library:
https://openlibrary.org/developers/api

TO DO:
--> build a works page that allows the user to pick an edition from a selected works
--> complete the edition page to allow reviews to be added and for the user to see others' reviews (scoring is already there) 
--> add search funcitionality to browse (need a search results page)
--> stretch goal: add advanced search to allow additional options in search
--> stretch goal: surface multi-language support
--> stretch goal: add user profile management (inc picture)

---------
Using the code
---------
This site was created using node and a postgres v17 database. You will need both.
I used node.js version v24.1.0, which was the latest at the time of writing. Using other version may yield unexpected results.

1. Create a file in root called .env

2. edit .env and include the following lines
    ---------------------------------------
    # BCrypt Gen
    SALT_ROUNDS = 15

    # Postgres
    PG_USER = [postgres username]
    PG_PASS = [postgres password]
    PG_DB = [postgres database name]
    PG_PORT = [postgres port]
    PG_HOST = [postgres hostname]
    ---------------------------------------

3. Run the queries in queries.sql to generate the database tables required in postgres

4. Run the following commands:

    npm i
    npm audit fix      (if needed)
    node app.js     (or nodemon app.js if you want to use nodemon instead)


Here are the stated objectives and requirements from the course:
---------
Objectives
---------
- Revise how to integrate public APIs into web projects.
- Gain more experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.
- Demonstrate ability to Create Read Update and Delete data in a PostgreSQL Database to persist data.

---------
Project Requirements
---------
1. Database Persistance
Persist data using a PostgreSQL database.
Use CRUD methods to manipulate data in the database.

2. Project Planning
Think through your project, researching the API documentation, project features, what data you will store, and how it will be used in your web application.
Draw a database diagram on draw.io and plan out any relationships.
Think through the PostgreSQL command you will need to write to create the schema for your database.

3. Project Setup
Set up a new Node.js project using Express.js.
Include pg for working with your localhost PostgreSQL database.
Include EJS for templating.
Create a frontend in HTML CSS JS.
Ensure that the project has a structured directory and file organization.

4. API Integration
Implement at least a GET endpoint to interact with your chosen API.
Use Axios to send HTTP requests to the API and handle responses.

5. Data Presentation
Design the application to present the book covers from the API and the data in your database a in a user-friendly way.
Use appropriate HTML, CSS, and a templating engine like EJS.
Think about how you would allow the user to sort the data from the database.

6. Error Handling
Ensure that error handling is in place for both your application and any API requests. You can console log any errors, but you can also give users any user-relevant errors.

7. Documentation
Include comments throughout your code to explain your logic.

8. Code Sharing
Use what you have learnt about GitHub to commit and push your project to GitHub so that you can share it with other students in the Q&A area, I'd love to see what you've build too! You can tweet at me @yu_angela
Include a Readme.md file that explains how to start your server, what commands are needed to run your code. e.g. npm i  and then nodemon index.js
